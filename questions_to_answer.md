# (1) Minimax 

(b) When AI always moves first, it has the advantage. Run the program a few times. Do you ever win?  To make it a little more interesting, use the random package to randomly choose a move for human before AI makes its first move.  Run the program a few more times.  Do you ever win?  Any difference in behavior when the human has the first move?
